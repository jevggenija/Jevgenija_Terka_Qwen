# LoRA Training Project

## Project Description
This repository contains the code and configuration to train a **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model** for image generation.  
LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models by updating only a small set of low-rank weights, reducing computational and memory requirements.  

This project specifically focuses on generating images inspired by the **Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski** art style.

## 2. Workspace Setup on RunPod

1. **Install ComfyUI**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI.git

2. **Create a Python virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    
3. **Activate the environment**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    
4. **Install ComfyUI Manager**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager

5. **Launch ComfyUI**
  - Close your terminal and open a new one

  - Activate the environment again:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    
  - Navigate to ComfyUI folder:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI
    
  - Launch the web interface:
    ```bash
    python main.py --listen

  - Wait ~30 seconds until a local address with port 8188 appears, indicating ComfyUI is running
6. **Access ComfyUI from browser**
  - In RunPod, locate Direct TCP Port Mapping
  - Copy the Public IP and external port (e.g., "http://206.41.93.58:52271/")
  - Paste into your browser to open ComfyUI with ComfyUI Manager
7. **Load JSON models to generate new images using the Qwen model**

## 3. Notes
- Ensure the Python virtual environment is activated before running any scripts
- Large datasets and models require sufficient disk space and memory to prevent crashes
- Recommended hardware: NVIDIA L40 GPU, 151 GB RAM, 400 GB disk

# üé® Dataset Overview

My image dataset consisted of **149 mixed paintings**, each paired with a **positive prompt**.  
Approximately **30 out of 149 images** included light scene descriptions ‚Äî still focused primarily on **artistic style** rather than narrative content.

To enhance stylistic diversity and strengthen **LoRA learning**, each image was associated with **2‚Äì3 prompt variations**, phrased differently but describing the same overall aesthetic.

## üß© Examples

### Example 1 ‚Äî Abstract (‚Äúpure style‚Äù)
   ```bash
<mojstylbeksinskiego> <mojstylbeksinskiego>, (masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed), dystopian surrealism, painterly brush strokes, oil painting on hardboard, muted tones, dramatic lighting, surreal organic shapes, elongated forms, expression of despair and transcendence, atmospheric perspective

### üèöÔ∏è Example 2 ‚Äî Scene-based (‚Äúlandscape / composition‚Äù)
   ```bash
A humanoid figure with bandaged head walking through ruins, painted in <mojstylbeksinskiego> style, elongated anatomy, haunting atmosphere, soft oil textures, dark red sky, emotional tension, chiaroscuro shadows

### üíÄ Example 3 ‚Äî Emotional variation
   ```bash
<mojstylbeksinskiego> <mojstylbeksinskiego>, somber surrealism, expressive brush strokes, depiction of anguish, blurred figures, oil painting technique, heavy textures, cold desaturated tones

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure Example
image_001_1.jpg ‚Üí 001_1.txt
image_001_2.jpg ‚Üí 001_2.txt
image_001_3.jpg ‚Üí 001_3.txt

---

## üí° Why It Works

- üîπ **Token reinforcement** ‚Äî Repeating `<mojstylbeksinskiego>` at the beginning helps anchor the unique token.  
- üîπ **Light textual variation** ‚Äî Small changes in phrasing teach the model to understand the range of the style rather than memorize fixed descriptions.  
- üîπ **Tag permutation** ‚Äî Mixing the order of tags (lighting, color, composition) provides CLIP with richer contextual signals.  
- üîπ **Phrase order shuffling** ‚Äî Moving color information toward the beginning or end helps CLIP better capture *conceptual* rather than *syntactic* connections.

Using the same token (`<mojstylbeksinskiego>`) across all paintings ensures that **LoRA recognizes it as a shared stylistic identity.**

---

## üåå ‚ÄúQuiet‚Äù Compositions

To maintain balance and prevent overfitting on dense, figure-heavy scenes, the dataset also included **1‚Äì2 calm compositions** ‚Äî such as minimal landscapes or architectural fragments.

Each of these ‚Äúquiet‚Äù images had **three gentle prompt variants**, focusing on **atmosphere and color harmony** rather than complex structures.
