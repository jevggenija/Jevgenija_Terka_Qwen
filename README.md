LoRA Training Project
This repository contains the code and configuration to train a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model for image generation. 
LoRA enables efficient fine-tuning of large pre-trained models by updating only a small set of low-rank weights, 
reducing computational and memory requirements.
Project Description: 


generated images based on Zdzislaw Beksinski art style
